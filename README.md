This project is a physics simulation using Matter.js, demonstrating interactions between various bodies, a propeller controlled by arrow keys, a slingshot, and a countdown timer. The example is based on code examples from [brm.io/matter-js](http://brm.io/matter-js/) and [shiffman/p5-matter](https://github.com/shiffman/p5-matter), with additional credit to Benedict Gross.

## Features

- **Propeller:** Control the propeller using the left and right arrow keys.
- **Birds:** Create new birds using the 'b' key.
- **Slingshot:** Reset the slingshot with the 'r' key.
- **Wrecking Ball:** A physics-based wrecking ball with constraints.
- **Countdown Timer:** A countdown timer with game over and victory conditions.

## Controls

- **Propeller Control:** Left Arrow (Increase speed), Right Arrow (Decrease speed)
- **Bird Creation:** 'b' key
- **Slingshot Reset:** 'r' key

## How to Play

1. Control the propeller using the left and right arrow keys.
2. Create new birds using the 'b' key.
3. Reset the slingshot with the 'r' key.
4. The countdown timer displays the time remaining.
5. Game over if the timer reaches zero with remaining boxes.
6. Victory if all boxes are destroyed before the timer runs out.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
